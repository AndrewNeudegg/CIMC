# CIMC CMS Project.
###### A compatmentalised CMS written in python, using Flask.

## Aims
This is a personal project that aims to enable me to move away from the traditional CMS to something that is more creative and flexible from a development perspective. All subcomponents of this project should be simply modifiable and extensions should be easily implemented using the existing schemes.
