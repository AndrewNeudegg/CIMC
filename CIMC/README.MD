## Structure 
This application is broken down into subsections where possible. Generally these fall into the categories associated with their respective URI routes, with the exception of the master template structure. As per the advice of the flask documentation (as of 03/11/2017), the template directiories are broken down into template\<domain>\<file>. Each master route should contain the data structures required for their operation and as such be entirely modular.
